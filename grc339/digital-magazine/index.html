                                <p>Street art and graffiti in NYC were a product of the 1970s, when the city was bankrupt and crime was rampant.

                                <p>Looking to establish a place where up and coming graffiti artists could hone their craft in a safe space, Harlem community leader Ray “Sting Ray” Rodriguez dubbed the concrete walls of the Jackie Robinson Educational Complex’s schoolyard to be the Graffiti Hall of Fame, and it has been attracting some of the best street artists in the world for more than 30 years.

All at once, he began to experience a multicultural urban community with its own expressive vocabulary; a lively environment in which to explore his gay identity; and a peer group, at the School of Visual Arts and in the vibrantly experimental East Village, as energetic and uninhibited as Keith himself...</p>

                                Banksy might be one of the most famous names in the world of art, but for the person behind the tag, it's a different story.

                                Additions of street art benefit urban environments by creating a safer community, generating relationships between constituents and businesses, and increasing economic revenue. Murals, while beautiful, don’t serve simply to brighten your day, but also are an integral part of creating a safer community.
