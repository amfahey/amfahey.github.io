                            <h2>Best Street Art in the City</h2>
                    
                                <p>Street art and graffiti in NYC were a product of the 1970s, when the city was bankrupt and  crime was rampant. Growing up in that environment, kids from the Bronx and Brooklyn tagged subway cars and buildings even though it was illegal and dangerous. Eventually, their new art form spread around the world and found its way into NYC galleries and museums in NYC. Street art thrives, ironically as a sanctioned activity sponsored by business owners, community groups and even developers. Now there are even famous street artists! But don’t worry: It’s still imbued with the same panache and attitude that made it so compelling back in the day—as you’ll see by checking out our list of the top spots to see graffiti in NYC.</p>

                                <p></p>

                                </figure>

                                <p> Banksy famously loves New York City—in 2013, he staged a monthlong, citywide “show” called “Better Out Than In”—but most of his work here has been covered over, torn down to be sold or defaced by taggers. At least this modest stencil piece on the Upper West Side is still intact, thanks to the building owner, who installed a Plexiglas shield in an act of guerilla art preservation.</p>

                                <p>Today’s Banksy piece is located on 79th Street, just east of Broadway, on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. “Hammer Boy” depicts a child playing the  high striker or strongman game commonly found at carnivals. Banksy’s website is silent as to its meaning or purpose only present a photograph of the work.  An individual attempted to deface Hammer Boy but viewers stopped him from defacing Banksy’s work. Over the course of the past few days, New Yorkers have begun taking a stronger stand against those attempting to vandalize Banksy’s works.</p>

                                <p>The creativity of the East Village spills out onto the walls at the First Street Green Art Park. The open art space gives artists and designers space to show off their murals, sculptures and other installations as well as hold performances for the neighborhood. Each time you go to this lesser-known spot should be a different experience as murals change often. Plus, during the warmer months, its volunteers hold programming from art workshops to live music.</p>

                                <p>Longtime Bronx trendsetters Tats Cru (Bio, BG183, Nicer, How and Nosm) found their latest ripe facade in 2008 and invited, among others, old friend Goldie, U.K. stencil pioneer Nick Walker, L.A.’s reputed Seventh Letter crew, Crash and Evoke to paint. Out of respect for the building’s owner, they avoid carving, wheatpaste and overt politicizing, but anything else goes. </p>

                                <p>Keith arrived in New York in 1978 as a scholarship student at the School of Visual Arts. All at once, he began to experience a multicultural urban community with its own expressive vocabulary; a lively environment in which to explore his gay identity; and a peer group, at the School of Visual Arts and in the vibrantly experimental East Village, as energetic and uninhibited as Keith himself...

                            <p>
                                Banksy might be one of the most famous names in the world of art, but for the person behind the tag, it's a different story. The street artist, whose thought-provoking works have appeared in almost every corner of the globe, could stroll past you in the street, and you would be none the wiser.

                            <p>
                                Additions of street art benefit urban environments by creating a safer community, generating relationships between constituents and businesses, and increasing economic revenue. Murals, while beautiful, don’t serve simply to brighten your day, but also are an integral part of creating a safer community.
