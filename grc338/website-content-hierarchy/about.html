        <h1>About Abby's Pasta Truck</h1>
        <p>
            Abby's Truck originated in San Luis Obispo, California where she attended California Polytechnic State University. Abby is the biggest pasta lover in the entire world, and realized after class one day that she had never seen a food truck that served pasta. From that day on, she was determined to change this. Abby's Pasta Truck revolves around the concept of building your own pasta bowl. We can create whatever you are craving! You can also check out our most popular bowls if you are feeling indecisive.
