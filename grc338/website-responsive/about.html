        <p>
            Abby's Truck originated in San Luis Obispo, California where she attended California Polytechnic State University. Abby is the biggest pasta lover in the entire world, and realized after class one day that she had never seen a food truck that served pasta. From that day on, she was determined to change this. Abby's Pasta Truck revolves around the concept of building your own pasta bowl. We can create whatever you are craving!

            Abby Fahey is a 20-year-old Graphic Communication student at California Polytechnic State University. Originally from Seattle, Abby absolutely loves all types of food and grew up trying different meals. However, her favorite always remained Italian.
     
            One day after class, Abby was starving and absolutely craving pasta. There were tons of food trucks around serving tacos, hotdogs, and even gyros. However, none were serving pasta. Abby realized that she had never seen a pasta truck in her entire life!
            From that day forward, Abby made it her life's mission to change this. Abby's Pasta Truck is her pride and joy.</p>
